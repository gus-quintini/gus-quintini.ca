### Graphic Designer/Professional Child


I have always been the loud outgoing person out of the bunch. Graphic Design is a way for me to give all of my obnoxious energy to the community in a medium that makes people happy.

When I was a child I would go to my father's agency and create balls out of vinyl. Somehow this sparked the idea in my brain to follow in his footsteps. Once I put my big boy pants on I realized that design was much more than just making pretty things, its about coming up with creative solutions to complex problems. This made my obnoxious heart fall in love with design even more.
